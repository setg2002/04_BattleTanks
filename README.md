# 04_BattleTanks
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and an advanced control system for unreal 4.

Using tutorials from https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/content section 4.


Over the past few days I've been working on an algorithm that changes the color of a surface in a rainbow-like pattern for a power-up item in my group's jame jam game. I got the original idea fro a turorial here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bYbFQ6Cius) and tried to improve upon it. The idea behind it was that on a color wheel, if you go around the outside edge like I was trying to emulate, one of the RGB values stays at 1, another stays at 0, and the third is a float between 0-1. The end result was:

It doesn't work perfectly as the color changes in more of a triangle hitting red, green, and blue instead of every color on the outside of the wheel. It works by taking the time as an input then passing it through a sine function with a period of 1 and then assigning that value to ethier the red blue or green channel. However, 1/3 and 2/3 is added to the green and blue channel repectively in order to "delay" when they reach 1 and 0. If this delay was not present, the red, blue, green channels would not change in sequence, but would rather fade in and out from white to black. Finally it then takes the RGB value and multiplies it by a Glow Strength (in this case 100) and uses the resulting value as the emissive color to make it glow. For example, at 0 seconds the red value would be 0, the green value would be 0.3333, and the blue value would be .6666 making it a light-ish blue. At 1 second the red would be .84, green would be .17, and the blue would be .51 making a light pink.


For this out of class assignment I researched game streaming services and how they will affect distribution. There are many companies now that are pursuing streaming games as a service. Some of these companies include Amazon, Sony, Microsoft, Google, and NVidia. Game streaming means these large companies will take a subscription fee, like Netflix or Spotify, and give you access to some of their computing power and stream the game to your device. This allows for playing games on machines that might not otherwise be capable, like mobile devices. Each company goes about this in a slightly different way. With NVidia's ‘GeForce Now’,https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/ , it will use your pre-existing steam library and play games from there. This allows publishers to only have to deal with steam to sell games and not another third party. This also means that your money was not wasted buying games on steam, whereas other game streaming services give a preloaded library. However, possibly the biggest questions with these new services is latency. No one would want to play a twitch shooter, fast-paced fighter, or any other game that requires millisecond precision on a stream that could be hundreds of milliseconds behind. Google recently did a test run from Oct. 1 2018 - Jan. 15 2019, of their service, Project Stream. During this time, participants could play Assassins Creed Odyssey within a chrome browser. Odyssey was not a game that was optimized for long distance streaming, but most people found it to be a pleasant experience at 1080p 30fps. The biggest complaint was the bitrate, which had a minimum of 15Mbps, being compared to a youtube video or twitch stream. If these services become mainstream, it could mean that it would become a necessity for programmers to optimize their games for streamed rendering.
